# Montana-Route-Planner

Created for my Web Science course at Montana Technological University.

PROBLEM:
Traveling Montana's interstates in winter can be dangerous, especially since weather conditions change often.

SOLUTION:
Create a full-stack, interactive web application that allows users to select a start and end point along Montana's interstate system (I-90, I-94, and I-15), and return forecasts along their selected route using the National Weather Service API. The project also included a secure login form to allow an admin user to access a statistics screen showing the most common selected routes for analysis by users.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (limited - mainly for API calls and parsing)
PHP
MySQL
